# docker-alpine-php-nightly
Docker Image for PHP nightly. Currently 8.0.0-dev.

This image is highly inspired by the [official Alpine PHP images](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/).

```
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp tommymuehle/docker-alpine-php-nightly php your-script.php
```

### Create a Dockerfile in your PHP project

```
FROM tommymuehle/docker-alpine-php-nightly
COPY . /usr/src/myapp
WORKDIR /usr/src/myapp
CMD [ "php", "./your-script.php" ]
